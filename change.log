- two primary apps: 
	- FOP()
		- positive pixel data on slides
	- mIFTOapp()
		- full analysis
- comestic fixes for the graphs and the GUIs as we see fit
- Convert the file to a html 
- mITFOapp: 
	- Needs to run titrations for the polymer
	- Refactor the code so that it ran for phenotype, pixel, and tissue segmentation (IP)
	- Produce bleedthrough or crosstalk graphs on the data
	- remove extra boxplots from the analysis (5% and all were boxplots to keep)
- FOP: 
	- also build graphs for postive pixels
	- also do the boxplots for counts data
