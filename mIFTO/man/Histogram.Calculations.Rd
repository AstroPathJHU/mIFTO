\title{Used by analysis funtions to do the calculations for the histogram graphs}
\usage{
Histogram.Calculations(data.in, Opal1, Concentration, Thresholds, x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.in}{is the vector of 8 column pixelbypixel data}

\item{Opal1}{is the Opal of interest(ie 540)}

\item{Concentration}{is a numeric vector of the denominator of all concentration ratios
which a boxplot will be created for (ie 25, 50, 100)}

\item{Thresholds}{is a list of the thresholds at each concentration (ie 5,4,3)}

\item{x}{is the Slide Indicator (ie Tonsil2)}

\item{y}{is the numeric value of the current concentration}
}
\value{
a list with two data.frames; one with a histogram for shift factor of log(x+1) and one with a shift factor of log(x+.001)
the data.frames hold four columns three for the create.hist output and one for the concentration of interest

\details{
Takes in the data and some constants from the PixelbyPixel script and returns a list with two data.frames
one for a histogram of the log(x+1) of the data and one for a histogram of log(x+.001) of the data
data.in is an col data.frame; Concentration: [25,50,100]; Opal1 540; Thresholds: [2,5,8];
to run for Tonsil2, 1to25 with threshold of 2 --> x: Tonsil2; y: 1
