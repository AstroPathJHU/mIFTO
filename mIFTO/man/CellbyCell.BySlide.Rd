CellbyCell.BySlide(out, pb)
}
\arguments{
\item{out}{is the list of vairables given by the GUI function}

\item{pb}{is the progress bar created by the GUI}
}
\value{
exports a variety of graphs displayed in the documentation
 Such as SNRatio graphs, Stain Index, and Seperation Index, t statisitics and graphs,

\details{
This function is desgined to do analysis for IF titration series in cell by cell data
providing output for each SLIDE individually grouped by concentration;

it is meant to be run through the RUN.BySlide function

decile data will always be outputed; (or 1/100th depending if
'sparse' option is choose in the GUI) if phenotype information is
filled out in the GUI; phenotype analysis will be run
